Making Numerical Lists

Using the range() Funciton
- the range() function causes Python to start counting at the first value you give it, 
- and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide. 
- because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end value
'''

for value in range(1, 5): 
	print(value)
	

print()
# if your looking for a range from 1-5, you would range(1, 6): 
for value in range(1, 6):
	print(value)
