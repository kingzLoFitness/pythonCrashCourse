2-8. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations
in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
print(5+3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once
on each line.
2-9. Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then,
using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print
that message.
