# Practical Learning of Python

Through this book I've taken my knowledge of Programming to a higher level with learning Classes, Methods...  A deeper understanding of Object Oriented Programming. 

It's been a few month since I last opened the book and I have to backtrack on it by going over most, if not all of Code and Comments I've written out.  

Looking forward to Creating Alien Invasion Project (Coming Soon)


NOTE: First Git to Github upload in a while with loading all my Directories (folders) and files within PythonCrashCourse Directory inside my Local hardDrive.
